Q2>Â 

First find the nearest square number less than the given number (X) . That is Y. If it is equal to the number the count is one. Otherwise find the remaining sum (X-Y^2).

The remaining part is futher divided in to two, if the remaining is not a square result.



For Example

If I take 100:

10^2 = count 1

9^2 + 19 => 19 can be written as 4^2+3 => 3 can be written as 1^2+2. Therefore it is not possible,.

8^2 + 36 => 6^2 (count 2)

like wise the algorithm can be go minus
